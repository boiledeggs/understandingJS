    4. Now push this new counter.value to the array which will append
    the value to the array and not overwrite it.

takes an element and a list and creates a new list that adds the element to the
front of the input list, and nth , which takes a list and a number and returns
the element at the given position in the list (with zero referring to the first
element) or undefined when there is no such element.
If you havenâ€™t already, also write a recursive version of nth .
